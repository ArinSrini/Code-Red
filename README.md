## Overview

This repository contains several components for working with audio data:

- **Audio_Functions.py**: Python module providing functions for audio preprocessing and feature extraction.
- **Audio_Scrambler.py**: Script for audio scrambling using encryption techniques.
- **Audio waveform modelling.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating audio preprocessing and waveform modeling.
- **Audio Functions.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook showcasing examples of functions from `Audio_Functions.py`.
- **a2m.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook detailing the process of converting audio to binary and reconstruction.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArinSrini/Code-Red.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Recording Audio

Use `Audio_Scrambler.py` to record audio and save it as a WAV file (`output2.wav`):

```bash
python Audio_Scrambler.py
```

### Audio Preprocessing and Modeling

Explore `Audio waveform modelling.ipynb` and `Audio Functions.ipynb` for examples and techniques related to audio preprocessing and feature extraction.

### Audio Scrambling

Use `Audio_Scrambler.py` to apply scrambling techniques to audio data. Modify the script to incorporate encryption methods like YASHE (BGV) for secure audio transmission or storage.

## Examples

Check out the Jupyter notebooks (`Audio waveform modelling.ipynb` and `Audio Functions.ipynb`) for detailed examples of audio preprocessing and feature extraction using `Audio_Functions.py`.
